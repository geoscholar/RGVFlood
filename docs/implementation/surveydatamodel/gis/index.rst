The required GNSS/GIS work shall result in a fully integrated GIS/GNSS system with covering entire developed portion of the RTHS Station. The GIS elements that are created shall be sufficient to allow the display visible items on RGVFlood website application.

The various elements that will be used to depict the site using the GIS mapping are to be made up of points, polylines and closed polygons that shall be created and displayed.

Graphical representation of the location and elevation, as well as the data information for the geographically displayed information, for the elements in the provided RGVFlood Geodatabase format shall be provided. The source for the graphical portion of the GIS shall be from the “As-Built” AutoCAD data supplemented with the field collected data. The geographic coordinate and elevation information for the elements being added to the GIS system, whether points, polylines or closed polygons, shall be collected and represented in the GIS based upon the accuracy level for the GNSS equipment being provided for the project being surveyed and mapped.
