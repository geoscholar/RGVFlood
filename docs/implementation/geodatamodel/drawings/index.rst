CAD Data Models
===============

The prupose of Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) Data Models is to poster consistent drafting, graphical representation, and CAD standards for surveying and modeling surveying and engineering documents. The 
information contained herein specifically applies to drawing deliverable requirements for RATES projects  (i.e., file naming conventions, sheet layouts, exported digital document files (PDF, DWF) and DWG output from native CAD software or exports from GIS or BIM software.

Drawing Deliverable Formats and Versions
----------------------------------------

Drawing Deliverable Requirements (DDR) refers to the general standards and requirements of the United States National CAD Standard® (NCS) and only amends the content therein when necessary. 

AutoDESK AutoCAD DWG file formats for deliverables must be fully compatible within one version of the  latest release of AutoCAD. Each DWG representing a sheet must be fully self-contained and all references and/or links bound. All 2D drawing files must be submitted in PDF 1.5 (or greater) file format, per ISO 32000-2 standard. All digital PDFs must be created directly from the native application (e.g. Revit, AutoCAD, Word, etc.).  Drawing line work must be vector based and scale independent.

Companion Files or Exteranl Reference Files
--------------------------------------------

Often CAD has external references files (XREF) and data reference files (DREF) attched to the DWG such as:
 - Project Files
 - Objects
 - Images
 - GIS
 - Other CAD Files
 - Survey Databases SQL
 - DTM, DSM, TIM, GRID, DEM, SDF, MBD, ASC, XML, RAW, CSV, PDF
 - Reports, Spreadsheets, Oject Sets
 - Plottying Style Tables

All files must follow DDR and be provied when sharing or providing a delieverable which include:
 - Drawing Naming
 - Coordinate System
 - Layers
 - Drafting Conventions
 - Plotting 


Drawing Naming
--------------------
To sustain the established structure and workflow of standardizing, updating, and organizing 2D  documents, the RATES requires strict compliance with the file naming conventions specified herein.  RATES CAD filenames must consist of:
 - Project NAME
 - Drawing Type
 - DATE in MM-DD-YY
 - Version in V#.#
 - File extension. 

Drawing Coordinate System
-------------------------
All horizontial and vertical coordinates shall follow RATES Survey Manual.  With the correct NAD83 and NAVD88 stated datums.

Drawying Layers
---------------
CAD Layer Guidelines apply to DWG files regardless of the software used (Civil 3D, Carlson, Intellicad, etc).  To maintain graphical fidelity, legibility, and usability of digital drawings, assign various and contrasting  colors, linetypes, and lineweights for CAD layers to enable visual on-screen identification and/or color  printing. Specific color numbers, linetypes, or lineweights for certain layers are not mandated. See Drawing Template for more details.

Drafting Conventions
--------------------
Scaled views for drawings must consist only of scales identified in the Engineering Common Scales List.  All scaled views represented on a sheet must have a corresponding graphic scale on the same  sheet. Graphic scales may be included as part of the title mark as indicated and  be placed at the bottom right hand corner of the sheet. Non-Scaled view (e.g., perspectives)  may be used as needed.

The standard linetypes and nine basic lineweights identified in the template.

Drafting Conventions does not mandate any particular text font be used but establishes a minimum printed height of 3/32”.  Notations require fonts to be capitalized, non-stylized (i.e., not italicized, underlined, bold, or  otherwise highlighted), and a Sans Serif font (e.g., Arial, or Arial Narrow) with a width factor of no less than 0.8.

Plotting 
---------

Plot quality has many determining factors including but not limited to: plotting equipment, plot configuration, pen settings, plot styles/tables used (CTB/STB), layer/element overrides, and/or layer names. Printing from the native authoring software with different variables across different systems can  yield inconsistent results; therefore, to enable more consistent graphical output, the submitted digital PDF files for any given project must be considered the official source for reprographic production in lieu of printing from the native authoring software, be it CAD or BIM.
