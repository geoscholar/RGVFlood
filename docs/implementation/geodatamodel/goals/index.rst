Goals of Geospatial Data Model
==========================

RATES will utilize Geospatial Data Model to provide stakeholders with a greater understanding of how data models areas are:
- Planning
- Collecting
- Sharing

This technical reference on Geospatial Data Model is not intended to specify in-process compilation or digitizing procedures but to present standards and requirements for outputs and deliverables.  The REON Manual and the Surveying Manual shall be referenced outside this document for collection standards for some aspects of digital Geospatial Data.

Goals for Planning
------------------

The purpose of this Geospatial Data Model is to provide guidance to the RATES Partners, that prepares the preliminary and final databases delivered to the public guidance. It is planned that the Geospatial Data collected meet the needs of decision makers and the public in mitigation, resiliency, and sustainable tools. 

RATES Geospatial databases will store the digital GIS data used in the map production process, as well as tabular information inside the RATES data sharing sites.

The most current version of these documents shall be used and obtained from the Geosptial Data Model standards for RATES Documents and Mapping webpage.

Goals for Collecting
---------

The Geospatial Data Model will provide requirments for collecting and adding Geospatial to the RATES tools.  The Geospatial Data Model includes:
 - Existing Databases
  - Geospatial GIS Layers
  - Surveying Data
  - Elevation Data
  - Surface Data
  - Gage Data
  - Hec Ras Models
  - Other
 - New Databases
  - REONS
  - RATES Station Benchmarks
  - RATES Station Site Surveys
  - Hydrological Cross Section Surveys
  - GPS on Benchmarks
  - Other
  
Goal of Sharings
---------------------------------

The Subject Authority shall verify and preserve Geospatial Data Model records containing adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions to furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of RATES.

All of the submitted GIS layers and tables must be in the same GIS file format and defined in this document.
